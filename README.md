# Story Time

#### A small web app that allows users to collaboratively write stories that are inspired by randomly selected pictures.

#### By Molly McGlone and Brett New, September 2016

## Description:

An Epicodus pair exercise to practice building a basic Ruby on Rails app.

User Stories:
* As a user, I want to see a list of stories (sorted alphabetically by most recently created to oldest) that I may contribute to on the main page so that I can choose where to contribute.
* As a user, I want to add a new story to the list of stories that anyone can contribute to.
* As a user, I want to be able to edit a story's properties (for example, change the title to fix a typo).
* As a user, I want to delete a story if I don't want to see it on the site any more.
* As a user, I want to be able to read a story when I select it, seeing all of the names, images and text for each contribution.
* As a user, I want to be able to contribute to a story by "rolling" the dice for an icon/image and adding a one-sentence contribution.
* As a user, I want to be able to edit contributions to correct any mistakes or change the content for clarity.
* As a user, I want to destroy my contributions if I don't like them or want them in the story.
* As a user, I want to see all of the icons/images that I might be able to roll.
* As a user, I want to be able to search for stories/contributions by keywords.
